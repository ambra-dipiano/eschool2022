This lecture gives broad and general introduction into creating plots, exporting them to files, doing animations, and show some example of more complex figures.
We will also introduce the matplotlib pgf backend, which allows producing plots using a LaTeX system, resulting in plots that are matching the look and feel of your LaTeX documents.
